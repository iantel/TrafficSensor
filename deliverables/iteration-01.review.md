##REVIEW
#TEAM 23

 * When: 13/10/17
 * Where: BA 2220

## Process - Reflection 


#### Decisions that turned out well

-Role assignments went well, everyone agreed to a role that fit their preferences/specialties. No disagreements amongst members.
- Our choice in languages and platforms for our project to be built on, we all chose technology that we have previous experience in, or show interest to learn.
- We have decided to use react native for the front end so that the app can run on both Android and iOS

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped


-Meeting schedules, since many of our members have varied schedules, multiple timing conflicts lead to strange meeting hours, or we just do it online (might not be as good as meeting in person).

-For the implementation of the sensor component, we were debating the merits of a sensor based approach vs a computer vision based approach, so far we have settled on the simpler sensor based approach. Accuracy has yet to be determined.

#### Planned changes


-If the sensor based hardware doesn’t perform as desired, we plan to switch it out for a computer vision based approach, or try different sensors(methods?).

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:


-Role assignment
-Platform/Language/Tech stack choice
-Implementation of hardware component



#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:


-None

## Meeting Highlights

See above



Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

-Mockup Design of User facing application
-Diagram of backend components
-Proof of concept for sensor based approach (IR vs UltraSonic) (measure accuracy/viability of this method).
