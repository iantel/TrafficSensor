## Process



#### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role.

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:


- First meeting took place in tutorial, followed by a 2nd meeting in BH 3200
- Purpose of each meeting will be to hammer out details of the project 
- We plan to have weekly meetings





#### Artifacts


 -Weekly To-Do list of tasks for each group member in order of priority
Tasks are assigned to the group member responsible to that section of the project(ie. Front end)
Tasks are ordered based on a hierarchy of dependencies. For example if a database is required for a specific functionality in the backend then the database would have a higher priority.


- We will communicate over slack and with pull requests for features
- A list of desired functionalities will be created and individual tasks will be created from these functionalities.
- We will use user stories to inform which functionalities we add.





## Product

#### Goals and tasks


Determine a feasible way to keep track of the number of people in a specified room. Our options are: a sensor by the entrance, location data sent from phones, and using computer vision to count the number of people in the room using a camera setup. We will need to research the viability of each of these implementations. 

We will decide if this will be an app for Android, iOS, or both and what language we will use for it. 




#### Artifacts



List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.


Can combine completed user stories & subtasks into a small file every iteration to gauge progress/idea. Will also produce mockups? Drawn out/Electronically made to represent UI wireframes (what we aim for the UI to look like). For the hardware aspect, we can bring the item for a simple demo of capabilities (registers moving person, etc.). May require setup time. The backend artifact will be UML diagrams to show the architecture of our server.
